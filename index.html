                Reinforcement Learning project for the course Artificial
                Intelligence in Winter 2022 Term. Used Q-learning to train a
                robot to learn to correctly pick up cans and avoid walls in his
                grid world. Receives a reward of for each can it picks up. Wrote
                a Q-learning method, using a Q-matrix, in which the rows
                correspond to states and the columns correspond to actions. The
                Q-matrix was initialized to all zeros at the beginning and is
                populated at each episode. Mapped sensor input to state-index in
                the Q-matrix. Learned over a series of episodes. Initially when
                the Q Matrix is empty, it has to take random actions and the
                rewards would populate the Q Matrix based on actions taken. As
                the Q Matrix gets progressively filled, Q Matrix can be referred
                to take the actions that would yield maximum reward.

                <b>Existing System:</b> Providing recruiters with documents that
                they have in the recruitment management. A single batch of 1000
                resumes is written to disk, batch by batch by a cron. Finally,
                when all documents are processed it is zipped and uploaded to
                Google Drive and shared with the recruiter.

                <b>Problem:</b> As huge data is prepared as zip. So, all files
                must be created on a single server. If one batch fails, the
                whole process needs to start from the beginning. After failure,
                it was hard to debug. Zip must be password protected as
                sensitive information is present.

              <p class="mx-auto w-75">
                <b>New System Design:</b> All Batches were created at the
                beginning and pushed to Kafka. Individual batches were processed
                and uploaded as zip that enables concurrency. If the consumer
                servers are increased, the time is reduced. For failure cases, a
                single batch must be processed again. Many times Heap Memory
                Error was faced. So Heap dump and gc logs were analyzed.
                Processing time of a single batch was recorded. Batch size,
                consumer max pool records, and interval were decided.
                Eventually, this made the process scalable, configurable and
                fast.
